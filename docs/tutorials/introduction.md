# Lesson 0: Introduction

*Creating a Hyperledger Fabric network is never an easy thing, and Hyperledger Cello has made it simpler.*

Welcome to the *Hyperledger Cello* tutorials. In the following lessons, you will learn about how you can set up a *Hyperledger Cello* server and agent and use them to create a *Hyperledger Fabric* network with ease.

The whole series is done using a *Ubuntu 22.04* computer, but it should be able to work on any *UNIX-like* operating system. If you encounter any problem trying to follow the tutorials, feel free to open an issue on our [*GitHub*](https://github.com/hyperledger-cello/cello/issues) page, or better, open a PR to solve it.
